1) create virtual env and activate it
        => python3 -m venv venv
        => source venv/bin/activate

2) install flask => pip install flask

3) install python-dotenv => pip install python-dotenv

4) install flask_jwt_extended =>

5) install flasgger => 

## we have to run these lines to run the flask app
    => export FLASK_ENV=development
    => export FLASK_APP=app (here app is the file name or module name which should run)
    => flask run


## it's not efficient to write three lines for running an app.
## that is why, we create a .env or .flaskenv file and set up the flask environment.
## but, in order to use the command set in .env or .flaskenv file we have to install a package called "python-dotenv"
    => pip install python-dotenv
